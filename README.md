# Rust - 101

Welcome to **Rust - 101**! This repository contains examples, exercises, and notes to help you get started with Rust, a systems programming language known for its safety, speed, and concurrency.

## Introduction

Rust is a statically-typed programming language that guarantees memory safety without using a garbage collector. Itâ€™s designed for performance and safety, particularly safe concurrency. This repository will guide you through the basics of Rust, from setting up your environment to writing your first Rust program.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts. Familiarity with systems programming languages like C or C++ is helpful but not necessary.
